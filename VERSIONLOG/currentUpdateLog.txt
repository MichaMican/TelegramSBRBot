New commands:
<b>/setcountdown [Date (dd.MM.yyyy)] [Time (HH:mm)] [Title]</b> answers a message which gets updated every minute till countdown is completed
<b>/stopcountdown (Reply to countdown message you want to cancel)</b> stops the countdown message you replied to
<b>/getutctime</b> returns the current UTC time which is used by the bot for all time references

Further changes:
- make internal structure run more async so multiple request at once are executed more performantly
- fix Bug which caused the bot to idle if the FunFact API didn't respond
- fix Bug where UpdateLog unsubscription resulted in unsubscribing from funfact service
