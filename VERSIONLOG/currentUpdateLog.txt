New commands:
	<b>/ping</b> - check if Bot is still online
	<b>/idea [Title] [Description]</b> - Submits a bot feature idea to the bot developer (Please use this feature only in private conversation with the bot!, it will get ignored otherwise)

Further changes:
	- Removed frontend, beacause it wasn't really used and it offered a sercurity loophole to the public
