New commands:
	/unsubupdates - This unsubscribes you from update log notifies
	/start - subscribes you to the update log notifies

New features:
	- If you start a private communication with the bot you automatically get subscribed to update log notifies
	- Bot now sends an updateLog when a new version of the bot was published
	- fix FunFact updates (the greedy garbage collector doesn't purge the update thread anymore)
